## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Overall this project does not use many frameworks that require installation. For the most part, this website was built using HTML5, CSS and JavaScript only. I did this with the intention of making it easy for users to download and view my code and how I went about implemenation. 

### Installation 
_Below is a direct link to download the source code and run the website on your IDE._
1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/courtmuel/Personal-Website.git
```

## Screenshots 
Below is a display of screenshots showing the finished website and dynamic images. In addition there is a short video showing the overall look of the website and its reactive sections.
